(set: _info to "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) is a type of client-side injection attack where a malicious script is injected into a legitimate website and executed. XSS attacks can occur when an attacker try to uses a web application to send malicious code, usually in the form of a browser-side script, to another end user.

Vulnerabilities that enable these attacks are widespread and occur wherever a web application ''uses input from a user within the output it generates without validating or encoding it.''

In this challenge you can try to insert a JavaScript alert() in the frame below. This JavaScript alert() should show up a pop up window.

For this CTF please imagine there is vulnerable Webseite on the Webserver (https://twine.ctf)
It is not necessary to look into the the code. 

Note: If you have injected XSS successfully, you will be redirected automatically.

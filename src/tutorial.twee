  <!-- Introduction to the game -->
  Welcome to the game "Memory Loss: Find Your Way Back". 
  This game is about using capture-the-flag challenges to teach the concepts 
  of IT security by learning attack techniques. Only when the various attack 
  techniques used by hackers to penetrate IT systems are known can the 
  appropriate countermeasures be taken.

  <h3>Modes</h3>
  <!-- Explain both modes: story and ctf -->
  The game is structured in such a way that the challenges are built into a story. This means that in places the challenges are built into the story that must be overcome in order for the story to continue. 

  However, it is possible to play the challenges without the story. To do this, click on "CTFs" in the menu.
